## Introduction
To familiarize myself with Networkx, I will complete a small project that aims to provide a clear and concise explanation along with practical implementations of the Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms for finding the shortest paths in graphs.


## Getting Started
For this project, I'm working with a comprehensive dataset of Texas roads and intersections, sourced from the [Stanford Large Network Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-TX.html).  To start, extract the dataset into the data/ directory using the following command:
```
gzip -d roadNet-TX.txt.gz
```
